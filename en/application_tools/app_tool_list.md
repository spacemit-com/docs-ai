# Application Software Stack & Development Tools

## 1. Ollama

Ollama is an open-source, cross-platform tool for **local deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It focuses on simplifying the process of running, managing, and performing inference with LLMs in local environments. Users can deploy and invoke pre-trained models (such as LLaMA and DeepSeek) on personal devices—such as PCs or edge servers—using simple commands, without relying on cloud services or high-end GPUs.
